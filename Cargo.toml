const_format = "0.2.26"

# Note for users on an older rust version:
# Some of the dependencies of this crate have explicitly or implicitly bumped their minimum supported Rust version
# without marking it as a breaking change according to semver versions.
# There is currently no reasonable way for this crate to support new features while still supporting older Rust versions
# as-is, and bumping the MSRV of this crate would be a breaking change itself.
# Instead, it might be necessary to fix some dependencies to an older version manually like this. Known cases are:
# cargo update -p const_format --precise 0.2.31
# cargo update -p quote --precise 1.0.40
# cargo update -p proc-macro2 --precise 1.0.101
# cargo update -p glob --precise 0.3.2
# cargo update -p unicode-width --precise 0.1.12
