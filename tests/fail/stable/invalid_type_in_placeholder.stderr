error: Invalid type in placeholder: expected identifier.
       Hint: The syntax for placeholders is {<type>} or {<type>:<config>}. Make sure <type> is a valid type or index.
       If you want syntax highlighting and better errors, place the type in the arguments after the format string while debugging:
       At "{.}"
